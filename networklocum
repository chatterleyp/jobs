Network Locum is an online marketplace in the health tech sector matching temporary (locum) GPs with practices looking to find someone to cover a session. We get over 10000 sessions posted every month, and are helping to transform the way the locum marketplace works.

We are funded with some well known investors, have a strong business plan that is generating revenue already and are now building our capability in delivering agile functionality to our customers.

We have grown dramatically over the last 4 months, with both increased users and clients hitting those all important metrics that investors like to see.

We are now growing our engineering team and are looking for developers with potential to grow with us as well as more senior developers that would like to take on more technical leading responsibilities.


technology stack comprises mainly of interconnected microservices in Python and Django chattering over Redis, with some Backbone.JS giving our frontend a bit of dazzle.
